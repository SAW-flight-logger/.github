Setup completed for the webhook
*PS: The "default" is the link of our test server, don't forget to set and choose your own airline, if u make this mistake, dm seabus0316 to find your flight information. 

How to use it?

Just enter the flight no. (ex:516) into the UI, and press "start flight logger"
If the airport isn't in the database (https://github.com/seabus0316/GeoFS-METAR-system/raw/refs/heads/main/airports_with_tz.json), it will ask you for the airport's ICAO, which means you have to enter it manually, or it will show "unknown" in the flight report.
In your flight log channel, now you should see a bunch of flight logs messages sent by your webhook

Terms and conditions of the SAW system:
1. You agree not to fake flights with the script
2. You agree not to make any major changes without giving notice to the creator due to technical reasons
3. You agree to give pilots decent preparation for using the script
